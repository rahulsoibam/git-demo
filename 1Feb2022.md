### Time Complexity

(in the worst case scenario, how many operations does the algorithm take)

`O(n)` is called **Big O Notation**

Ranked from fastest (least number of operations to most)

$ O(1) $
- example, HashMap Lookup

$ O(\log{n}) $
- example Binary Search

$ O(n) $ 
- example, Linear Search

$ O(n \log{n}) $ or $ O(n \lg{n}) $ where the log is of base 2 
- example Quick Sort

$ O(n^{2}) $
- example, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort.

$ O(n^{3}) $
- example, Naive Matrix Multiplication

$ O(2^{n}) $
- Recursive fibbonacci

$ O(n!) $
- example, Naive Solution of Travelling Salesman Problem
